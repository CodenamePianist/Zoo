        <h1>Zoo Animals</h1>
    </header>
    <h2>Bears</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ollie</li>
        <li>Mona</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The brown bear's fur is very thick, which gives its body a round impression. The bear's ears are small and round yet clearly distinguishable. The colour of the bear varies from black-brown to yellow-brown.</p>
    <h2>Giraffes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Frankie</li>
        <li>Coconut</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The giraffe has a short body, a tufted tail, a short mane, and short skin-covered horns. The back slopes downward to the hindquarters. The coat is pale buff, with reddish brown spots. The giraffe feeds primarily on acacia leaves.</p>
    <h2>Lions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Mella</li>
        <li>Karl</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Lions have strong, compact bodies and powerful forelegs, teeth and jaws for pulling down and killing prey. Their coats are yellow-gold, and adult males have shaggy manes that range in color from blond to reddish-brown to black.</p>
    <h2>Monkeys</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cookie</li>
        <li>Earl</li>
        <li>Banana Pudding</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Monkeys are some of the most common animals found around us. They mostly live on trees and come down on land for food. Monkeys are characterised by their furry bodies, long legs and hands, and a tail that can be used to grasp or hold things.</p>
    <h2>Alligators</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Wren</li>
        <li>Aspen</li>
        <li>Mika</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Alligators have a long, rounded snout that has upward facing nostrils at the end; this allows breathing to occur while the rest of the body is underwater. The young have bright yellow stripes on the tail; adults have dark stripes on the tail. It's easy to distinguish an alligator from a crocodile by the teeth.</p>
